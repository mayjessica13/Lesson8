				<h3>History of the Podcast</h3>
			<div class="text">	
				<p>Since the first podcast episode aired on November 28, 2012, Brian Posehn and a group of friends have been gathering once a week to play Dungeons and Dragons while recording their exploits. The appeal of the podcast lies not only in following the progression of the game, but also in the comic interplay between the "friends". The original cast consisted of the leader of the podcast, comedian and writer Brian Posehn, writer Gerry Duggan, comedian and writer Blaine Capatch, former actor and writer Ken Daly, writer Sarah Guzzardo, and the Dungeon Master "Mr.Sark" a.k.a. Scott Robison.</p>
				<p>And so it began, the players have awoken to find themselves stowed away aboard a ship with no memory as to how they have gotten there or where their clothing and weapons might be located. Eveyone has chosen a character to play on this campaign as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Brian began playing as Amarth Amon, a slow-witted goliath barbarian</li>
					<li>Blaine began as a half elf warlock named Blackee Green "with a 19 charisma"</li>
					<li>Ken was a dragonborn fighter named Bartho Shett</li>
					<li>Gerry declared himself to be Ell Ryan, a shaman with a spirit bear</li>
					<li>Sarah played as the dwarf warrier Mildred Maxton</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The group was slightly dismayed that their characters were beginning their adventures naked and weaponless and kicked things off by starting a search for their gear.<p>
				<p>As the story unfolded each week, some characters were lost before ever even clothing themselves (Ell Ryan), while others traveled to underwater realms, encountered a devious necromancer, were transformed into rats, and eventually got the revenge they sought. The campaign finale aired on April 30, 2014 and the group of friends has not been the same since. The Dungeon Master, Scott Robison went on hiatus at that point and, unfortunately, did not return to the game. Later Gerry Duggan and Sarah Guzzardo both left the show due to job and family time constraints. These days the "friends" are comprised of the original cast members Blaine Capatch and Ken Daly, and they have been joined by Steve Agee, Dan Telfer and assorted guests.</p>
