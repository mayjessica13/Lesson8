				<h3>Meet the Players</h3>

				<div class="bio">
					<img src="images/brian.jpg"/>
					<p><strong>Brian Posehn</strong> - comedian/ actor/ writer/ metalhead, known for writing and appearing on Mr. Show with Bob and David and more recently collaborating with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross on the book &quot;Hollywood Said No!: Orphaned Film Scripts, Bastard Scenes, and Abandoned Darlings from the Creators of Mr. Show&quot; published in 2013. He was also a fixture on The Sarah Silverman Program. A true Renaissance man, Posehn has appeared in a huge number of sitcoms and movies, written and co-written graphic novels and comic books, released comedy albums, and tours constantly as a stand-up. Somehow he fits regular recordings of Nerd Poker into all of this.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="bio">
					<img src="images/blaine.jpg"/>
					<p><strong>Blaine Capatch</strong> - comedian/ writer/ musician, has appeared on Mr. Show, the Comedians of Comedy, the Eleventh Hour, and hosted the second season of Comedy Central&rsquo;s Beat the Geeks. He has written on the Mind of Mencia, Blue Collar TV, MADtv, Web Soup, and @Midnight. He also plays guitar for The Tulsa Skull Swingers and regularly appears at Lucha Va Voom. His incredibly quick-witted banter, &quot;Brought to you by&quot; spots, and obscure television and pop culture references keep the Nerd Poker listeners on their toes.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="bio">
					<img src="images/ken.jpg"/>
					<p><strong>Ken Daly</strong> - actor/ writer/ producer, was a child actor who appeared in various tv shows such as Simon &amp; Simon and Quincy M.E., as well as a McDonald&rsquo;s commercial for Shamrock Shakes, and movies that include The Karate Kid and The Usual Suspects. He appeared in several episodes of Mr.Show and an episode of The Sarah Silverman Program.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="bio">
					<img src="images/gerry.jpg"/>
					<p><strong>Gerry Duggan</strong> - writer, friend and writing partner of Brian Posehn (they co-wrote The Last Christmas). He was adept at creating D&amp;D characters that would immediately annoy Brian and make his character want to kill them. Gerry eventually had to bow out of Nerd Poker, mainly because he seems to be a writer on numerous Marvel comics (Hulk, Batman: Arkham Manor, Deadpool, Chewbacca, Uncanny Avengers, and Nova) and Sunset Overdrive on the Xbox One. It&rsquo;s no surprise that Gerry had no time for regular games of Dungeons and Dragons. He is missed.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="bio">
					<img src="images/sarah.jpg"/>
					<p><strong>Sarah Guzzardo</strong> - writer and something of a mystery. She used to run the website Avoidthisjob.com. Sarah has very little online presence, possibly because she&rsquo;s not an actor/entertainer and is more of a normal person. She remains the only past or present &quot;cast member&quot; of Nerd Poker who is a woman. She is missed.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="bio">
					<img src="images/sark.jpg"/>
					<p><strong>Scott Robison (Mr. Sark)</strong> - gamer/ host/ dungeon master, reviewed games on G4TV&rsquo;s X-Play and then moved to Machinima Respawn. He now has a presence on Youtube (youtube.com/themrsark) and Twitch (twitch.tv/themrsark). Both loved and reviled by the group for his horrendous impersonations, love of Michael Bay movies, and for being &quot;a shitty DM&quot;, he left the show shortly before his first kid was born. Like Gerry and Sarah, he is missed.</p>
